## Overview

Argus Echo was originally scoped as a nuclear power plant intrusion detection system. The core problem: sophisticated state-sponsored actors execute **Replay Attacks** on ICS infrastructure — freezing a sensor's output to broadcast a perfectly normal baseline to the control room while physically sabotaging the machinery in reality. Standard time-series AI fails to catch this because a flatline has near-zero reconstruction error.

**The constraint that shaped the architecture:** Nuclear plant SCADA telemetry is classified. No public dataset exists. Rather than abandoning the research, the system was redesigned as a **domain-agnostic Edge AI framework** — mathematically rigorous enough for nuclear-grade ICS security, but deployable against any operator's telemetry.

**For this public deployment**, Argus Echo is trained and validated against the **HAI 22.04 dataset** — a hardware-in-the-loop simulated steam-turbine and pumped-storage hydropower system developed by researchers at the Affiliated Institute of ETRI. It is the most rigorous publicly available ICS security benchmark and serves as a direct proxy for the kind of telemetry found in safety-critical infrastructure.

> A nuclear plant operator would deploy their own instance, train on their SCADA normal-operation data, and get a model specific to their facility. The HAI deployment demonstrates the pipeline on real ICS data — the architecture is identical, only the training data changes.

## The Core Technical Problem

Standard LSTM Autoencoders detect anomalies by measuring reconstruction error (MSE) between input and predicted sequences. This works for spikes and deviations — but fails catastrophically for Replay Attacks:

```
Replay Attack → sensor output frozen → perfect flatline
LSTM-AE sees flatline → reconstructs it perfectly → MSE ≈ 0
System reports: NO ANOMALY  ← catastrophic failure
```

This is the **Low-Entropy Blind Spot** — the model inherently trusts perfectly static data.

**Argus solves this mathematically, not by scaling the model:**

```python
# Before tensor sequence creation, compute rolling variance per sensor
σ² = (1/N-1) Σ(xᵢ - x̄)²

# When a sensor is spoofed and flatlines:
# variance → exactly 0.0
# In a thermodynamic system, 0.0 variance is a physical impossibility
# The ~3,300 parameter LSTM-AE flags this as a massive anomaly
```

The computational burden shifts from the deep learning layer to a deterministic feature engineering layer — keeping the model lightweight enough for Edge microprocessor deployment.

### RAGAS Faithfulness as an Operational Trust Indicator

Every Echo interpretation is automatically scored. The faithfulness score is repurposed from an academic LLM evaluation metric into an **operational safety feature**:

| Faithfulness | Confidence | Operator Action |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 0.85 | HIGH | Interpretation grounded in ICS literature — act on it |
| 0.60–0.85 | MODERATE | Partially inferred — verify before acting |
| < 0.60 | LOW | Insufficient documentation — escalate to security team immediately |

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Groq API key — free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
- HAI 22.04 dataset — [icsdataset/hai](https://github.com/icsdataset/hai)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naurjhanvi/argus-echo
cd argus_echo

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment

```bash
# .env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### Train on HAI 22.04

Download the HAI 22.04 dataset. Use any normal-operation CSV for training:

```bash
python train_model.py path/to/hai_normal.csv
```

This generates `anomaly_detection_model.keras`, `scaler.pkl`, and `model_config.pkl`. The model automatically reads the shape of your CSV — 87 HAI sensors become 174 features (87 raw + 87 variance). No hardcoded sensor names.

### Build Echo Knowledge Base

Add ICS security PDFs to `data/` then:

```bash
python -c "from echo.ingest import ingest_data_folder; print(ingest_data_folder())"
```

### Run Locally

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The current Streamlit app is multi-user. On first launch, create an account, then either:

- train a facility-specific model from a normal-operation CSV in the **Train Model** tab, or
- import the existing local artifacts if these files are present at the repository root:
  `anomaly_detection_model.keras`, `scaler.pkl`, and `model_config.pkl`.

User accounts, uploaded training files, model artifacts, diagnostic runs, and anomaly history are stored under `ml/` by default. Override this for production with:

```bash
ARGUS_STORAGE_DIR=/app/ml
ARGUS_DB_PATH=/app/ml/argus_echo.db
```

## Deployment Philosophy & Future Work

### Why a Local MVP?
Argus Echo is intentionally scoped as a local Streamlit application for its MVP phase. Because this system is designed for classified, safety-critical ICS environments (like nuclear power plants), relying on external cloud APIs and public web deployments introduces unacceptable vulnerabilities. The primary focus of this build is proving the rigor of the **LSTM anomaly detection logic** and the **RAG-based operator guidance pipelines**. 

### The Path to "True Edge"
The target architecture for production will bypass cloud deployment entirely in favor of a true, air-gapped Edge deployment:
- Replace Groq with a locally quantized LLM (e.g., Mistral 7B via Ollama).
- Deploy via K3s (lightweight Kubernetes) directly onto on-premise industrial servers.
- Ensure zero telemetry data leaves the facility's localized network.

## Production Deployment Philosophy (GKE)

*Note: The project has fully Dockerized services and Kubernetes manifests written for a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) deployment. I am currently blocked on cloud credits, but the deployment configuration is entirely in place. I mention this because it reflects how I approach engineering: I don't stop at making something work locally. I want to understand how it runs in production.*

This repository includes a container-first deployment path for a public demo URL and for showcasing `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `GKE`, `LLMs`, and `RAG` together in one project.

### What is included

- `Dockerfile` for a production-style Streamlit container
- `.streamlit/config.toml` for headless cloud runtime
- `k8s/namespace.yaml` for environment isolation
- `k8s/deployment.yaml` with health probes and resource requests
- `k8s/service.yaml` exposing the app through a public `LoadBalancer`
- `k8s/secret.example.yaml` for the Groq API key

### Before You Deploy

Decide how the public demo should be initialized:

- For a guided demo, include root-level `anomaly_detection_model.keras`, `scaler.pkl`, and `model_config.pkl` in the Docker build context so the first user can import them.
- For a clean operator workflow, deploy without model artifacts and train the model inside the app after creating an account.
- Include the `data/` PDF corpus if Echo retrieval should be available immediately.
- Provide a valid `GROQ_API_KEY` through the Kubernetes secret or container environment.

Runtime state is intentionally excluded from the container image:

- `ml/` contains the SQLite database, uploaded CSVs, trained models, diagnostic outputs, and should be mounted as persistent storage in production.
- `vectorstore/` is generated from `data/` and can be rebuilt from the Echo Guidance tab.

### 1. Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t argus-echo:latest .
docker run -p 8501:8501 --env GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here argus-echo:latest
```

The container uses `requirements.runtime.txt` instead of the full research dependency set in `requirements.txt`. This keeps the deployment image smaller while still including the packages needed for the Streamlit app, in-app training, and Echo guidance.

### 2. Push to Google Artifact Registry

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev

docker tag argus-echo:latest \
  us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/argus-echo/argus-echo:latest

docker push \
  us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/argus-echo/argus-echo:latest
```

### 3. Deploy to GKE

Create a GKE cluster, then apply the manifests:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/secret.example.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```

Update `k8s/deployment.yaml` with your real Artifact Registry image path before applying it. Replace the placeholder in `k8s/secret.example.yaml` with your real Groq key before applying it. The deployment manifest also creates a `10Gi` persistent volume claim and mounts it at `/app/ml` so user accounts, uploaded files, trained models, and diagnostic history survive pod restarts.

### 4. Get the public URL

```bash
kubectl get svc -n argus-echo
```

When the external IP is assigned, the app is reachable at:

```text
http://EXTERNAL_IP/
```

For a cleaner portfolio URL, point a custom domain at the load balancer IP through Google Cloud DNS.

### Resume Framing

This deployment demonstrates:

- containerized ML plus RAG application delivery with Docker
- Kubernetes workload orchestration on GKE
- secret management for LLM API access
- health-checked public service exposure through a cloud load balancer
- end-to-end applied AI workflow: anomaly detection, retrieval, grounding, and operator guidance
